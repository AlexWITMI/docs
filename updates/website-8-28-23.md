ðŸš€ **Introducing Our New Website Beta: A Fresh Look at What's to Come!** ðŸš€

We're thrilled to announce the beta release of our brand-new website! After months of hard work and dedication, we're excited to provide you with a sneak peek into the future of our online presence. This release represents a significant milestone as we continue to enhance your experience and offer you a seamless way to interact with our products.

**What's New in the Beta Release?**

This beta version of our website is not just a simple update â€“ it's a complete ground-up reconstruction! We've revamped both the backend and frontend to provide you with a more efficient, user-friendly, and visually appealing platform. Quinn and I have been working tirelessly to bring you a website that aligns with the latest industry standards and offers a smoother navigation experience.

**Transitioning from the Old to the New**

We understand that change can sometimes be daunting, which is why we've taken a user-centric approach to this transition. The old website is still fully functional and accessible, allowing you to continue using it without any interruptions. Both the old and new websites are capable of accepting payments, ensuring that your transactions are as seamless as ever. Upon your first log in our new servers should migrate your account. However any future purchases on the old site will note be moved over.

**Share Your Feedback and Shape the Future**

We value your input and invite you to be a part of this exciting journey! As a beta user, your feedback will play a crucial role in refining our website further. If you encounter any issues, have suggestions, or simply want to share your thoughts, please take a moment to fill out this feedback form: [Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/38vagMJ1JM4ebXRLA). Your insights will guide us as we make the necessary adjustments to provide you with an exceptional online experience.

**Payments Handled Securely by Stripe and PayPal**

Rest assured, the security and integrity of your payments remain our top priority. Our new website still utilizes the trusted payment gateways, Stripe and PayPal, to handle all transactions securely. You can continue making payments with confidence, knowing that your financial information is in safe hands.


ðŸŒŸ **Lets Go Over What's New** ðŸŒŸ

We're thrilled to introduce you to the exciting array of new features that await you on our beta website. Our mission is to continually enhance your interaction with our platform, and these additions are designed to make your journey even smoother and more convenient. Let's dive right in:

**1. Comprehensive Documentation for Your Convenience**

We believe in empowering our users with knowledge. That's why we're excited to announce our new documentation hub, accessible at [boardsource.xyz/docs](https://new.boardsource.xyz/docs). But that's not all â€“ we're taking things a step further by making our documentation open source! You can explore and contribute to the documentation repository on GitHub: [Docs](https://github.com/boardsource/docs). Plus, the server powering our docs is also open source and available on GitHub: [Docs_server](https://github.com/boardsource/docs_server). With this invaluable resource, each product page now includes a build guide and other helpful information, providing you with the tools you need for a seamless experience.

**2. Streamlined Address Management with "Saved Addresses"**

We understand the importance of convenience, especially when it comes to address input during the checkout process. Our new "Saved Addresses" feature allows you to store frequently used addresses securely. Say goodbye to repeatedly typing in your information â€“ now you can breeze through the checkout process with just a few clicks.

**3. Enhanced Support Page for Your Queries**

Your questions matter, and we're committed to providing you with the best support possible. Our revamped support page is now more user-friendly and informative than ever before. Whether you need assistance with troubleshooting, product information, or any other queries, our support page is your go-to destination.

**4. Take Control of Your Orders**

We understand that circumstances can change, and we want to make sure you have the flexibility you need. You can now cancel orders before your card is charged â€“ no need to reach out to support! Additionally, we're introducing the ability to change your order's shipping address up until the moment it's shipped, all within your control.

**5. Seamless Shopping with Cart Sessions**

We've revamped our cart sessions to ensure that your shopping experience is as smooth as possible. Now you can add items to your cart from multiple tabs, just like you would on any other modern website. Your cart will stay in sync across different tabs, making shopping more convenient than ever before.

ðŸ”§ **Behind the Scenes: The Tech Stack Powering Our Beta Website** ðŸ”§

We're not just transforming the way our website looks and feels, but also how it's built from the ground up. Our tech stack plays a crucial role in delivering a seamless experience. We wanted to give you a peek into the technologies that are driving the new website:

**1. Backend Magic with Medusa JS**

At the heart of our operations, we're powered by Medusa JS ([Medusa js](https://medusajs.com/)), an exceptional backend framework that's all about enabling seamless e-commerce experiences. Medusa JS provides us with the tools we need to handle everything from order processing to inventory management, ensuring that your interactions with our platform are as smooth as can be. In our last website we built this all ourselves, but we have learned that sometimes you don't need to roll everything yourself. This will allow us to focus on what's important, instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel.

**2. Frontend Brilliance with Next.js**

Our frontend is built on the robust foundations of Next.js ([https://nextjs.org/](https://nextjs.org/)), a powerful React framework. We chose nextjs for the ability to pick between server rendering and static generation, and for the ease of integrating with other frameworks and libraries.

**3. Search Excellence with Algolia**

We know that finding what you're looking for quickly is essential. That's where Algolia ([Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)) comes in. With Algolia's lightning-fast search capabilities, you can easily discover the products you need, right when you need them.

**4. TypeScript: A Common Language**

Consistency is key, and that's why we've chosen TypeScript as our language of choice for both frontend and backend development. This helps streamline the development process, catch potential issues early, and deliver a more stable and reliable experience for you.

**5. Image Hosting with DigitalOcean Spaces**

Images are worth a thousand words, and they deserve a reliable home. We're using DigitalOcean Spaces ([DigitalOcean Spaces](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/)) for image hosting. We made this decision because  we like the streamlined version of AWS buckets DigitalOcean provides.

**6. Shipping Made Simple with Shippo**

Behind every successful e-commerce transaction is a smooth shipping process. We've continued with Shippo ([Shippo](https://goshippo.com/)) to handle our shipping labels. They have a very simple API making it easy for us to get the products shipped. Since making our first website Shippo has added some new features that we are also using like orders and packing slips.


**A Long-Awaited Transformation**

This beta release marks the culmination of months of dedication, innovation, and teamwork. We're incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and we're even more excited to share it with you. As we move forward, your support and feedback will continue to drive our commitment to excellence.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. We can't wait to hear your thoughts and make this website the best it can be. Here's to a new era of seamless browsing and hassle-free interactions!

Warm regards,

Boardsource

Cole and Quinn
