**Important Update: Temporary Removal of PayPal as a Payment Option**

Dear Valued Customers,

We always strive to provide you with the most seamless and reliable shopping experience at Boardsource.xyz. It is our constant endeavor to ensure that every interaction you have with our website is smooth, secure, and user-friendly. That is why we launched our new website about 1 month ago. We have fixed many bugs since the launch and made many improvements to the system. 

In line with our commitment to transparency and maintaining the best interests of our customers, we want to inform you of a recent development regarding our payment methods.

**What's Changing?**
Effective immediately, we have temporarily removed PayPal as a payment option on our website. While PayPal is a widely-used and trusted payment method, we have encountered a technical bug with our e-commerce back end system that specifically affects PayPal transactions.

**What's the Bug About?**
This bug, unfortunately, causes our website to become unstable, and in certain scenarios, to crash. Even more concerning is that some orders might not be captured fully, meaning they could be left incomplete or might not get processed at all. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. 

**What's Being Done?**
We have already alerted the developers of our e-commerce back end system about the issue. They are fully aware and are working to address it. However, as of now, there isn’t a specified timeline for when this bug will be fixed. We believe in being proactive rather than reactive; hence, we've decided to temporarily disable PayPal until a solution is implemented. There is a temporary fix available to combat this issue but the fix sadly does not work for PayPal accounts in the United States.

**What Are the Alternatives?**
While we sort this out, we still offer a range of other payment methods that are safe and reliable. Customers may place orders using Stripe (Debit/Credit Card), Google Pay, Apple Pay, Affirm, or Klarna installment plans. Customers may still checkout using a PayPal Debit card via Stripe.

**What's Next?**
We will be closely monitoring the situation and will reinstate PayPal as a payment option as soon as the bug is resolved and it's deemed reliable for our customers to use PayPal again. Rest assured, we will keep you updated and let you know when this issue is resolved.

We deeply value your trust and patience during this time. If you have any concerns or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our customer support team at help@boardsource.xyz. We're here to help!

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
Warm regards,

Quinn and Cole
