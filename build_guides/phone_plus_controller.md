Break apart the PCB to do so use some clippers to clip the mouse bites.

# Soldering

## Controller 

Place your controller on the top side of the pcb (opposite of the hotswaps) and line up the holes in the pcb. 
> **tip:** it can be helpful to use some of the pins included with the controller to line up the contrler but we **DO NOT** solder the pins into the pcb.

## Finish the build

Place the PCB labeled as `level 0` onto the back of your PCB

![soldering the case together pt1](https://i.imgur.com/2SxWWA9.jpg)

And solder through one of the holes on the `level 0` plate.
Once you are happy with the alignment, do the other 2 holes.

Next lay `level 2` onto the PCB over the installed switches and controller, and solder the holes together again.


Follow the same for `Level 3`

# Flashing.

## Downloads
This kit uses the awesome [gp2040-ce](https://gp2040-ce.info/) gamepad firmware 

Download the file below.
* [firmware](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE/releases/download/v0.7.9/GP2040-CE_0.7.9_WaveshareZero.uf2)


Once you have the file downloaded we need to flash the firmware. 
To do so you need to hold down the boot button on the blue controller in the center, while you plug in the controller to your computer.

After you do that it will show up as a drive and you can transfer the .uf2 file you downloaded from the first link.
