This build guide is designed to work seamlessly with all Equals keyboard kits,
offering compatibility with both MX and Choc switches, as well as the choice
between 48 or 60 layouts. Notably, when assembling an Equals 60 keyboard, there
is no requirement to snap off the PCB, simplifying the process. Furthermore, for
Choc builds, the PCB eliminates the need for a stabilizer, further streamlining
the assembly. This user-friendly guide ensures a smooth and hassle-free
experience across different Equals keyboard variations, accommodating diverse
preferences and needs with clarity and precision.

# Step 1 The Break!
## **Important READ!**

If you're assembling an Equals 60 keyboard, you can skip Step 1 in the guide,
which involves snapping off the PCB. It's essential to highlight that once the
PCB is snapped, it's a permanent change. However, this step is unique to the
Equals 48 / 4x12 layout and doesn't apply to the Equals 60 / 5x12 layout. This
adjustment simplifies the assembly process and maintains the keyboard's
integrity by avoiding irreversible modifications.

## For Equals 48 / 4x12
Hold the PCB and slowly bend the bottom row until you here it snap, working up
and down the length of the keyboard.

**Note on Technik Case:** For builds in a Technik case Depending on how the snap
goes you may need to trim / sand the Broken ends for the PCB to fit in the case.

# Step 2 Line it up.

Aligning the plate, plate foam, and PCB is a straightforward process, as they
are designed to fit together in only one specific orientation. Ensuring proper
alignment is crucial for optimal performance and stability. Just take your time
to make sure the missing intersections in the late foam line up with the post
holes on the PCB and the screw holes in the plate line up with the same post
holes.

You should be left with a stack that sits:

* **FR4 Plate**
* **Foam**
* **PCB**

**Note on Choc Builds:** Due to the shorter height there is not enough space
between the plate and the PCB for foam so no foam is required(or included).

# Step 3 Put the Switches in!
Now that all the holes line up you can insert your switches. Make sure that you
line up the metal pins on the switch with the hotswap on the PCB each switch can
only go in one way to work. When inserting your switch support the back of the
hotswap to insure you dont break the PCB while installing switches (which can
happen if the switch is miss aligned.)

Now you can test your PCB to make sure every switch works if not pop out the
switch that does not work and check for bent pins.
# Step 4 Getting so Close.
Drop your PCB / Plate / Switch assembly into the case.

Screw in the plate, there are 6 screws needed and 10 included. This is where you need your screwdriver.
