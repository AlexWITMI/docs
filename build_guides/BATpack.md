### Required 
| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| BAT Pack PCB| 1 |
| BLE Controller | 1 |
| power Switch | 1 |
| Battery | 1|

The Bat Pack is really quite simple and is just a small pcb that gets soldered to the back of your BLE controller in-place of the battery.
and adds a power switch that sits right on top of the USB Port.

## Assembling the Bat Pack
The Soldering on the Bat pack is quite simple. All you need to do to put it together is solder the SMD slide switch onto the PCB.

Then solder the BLE Controller onto the BAT Pack PCB.

## Done 

From there you can treat your controller as normal but the battery is taken care of.
This is not always needed and its better to use the switch placement on your pcb if it supports that.
If not this is a wonderful option to have.
