# Benefits of Mechanical Keyboards

Mechanical keyboards are keyboards that use physical switches under each key to register keystrokes, unlike membrane keyboards that use electrical contacts. Mechanical keyboards have been around for a long time, but they have gained popularity among gamers, typists and enthusiasts in recent years. Here are some of the benefits of using a mechanical keyboard:

- **Long-lasting**: Mechanical keyboards are more durable than membrane keyboards, as they can withstand up to 50 million keystrokes⁴, compared to 5 million for standard keyboards .
- **High stability**: Mechanical keyboards are heavier and sturdier than membrane keyboards, which means they don't slide around or flex when typing or gaming.
- **High NKRO**: NKRO stands for N-key rollover, which means the keyboard can register multiple simultaneous key presses without ghosting or missing any inputs. Most mechanical keyboards have high NKRO, which is useful for fast typists and gamers who need to execute complex commands.
- **No wear out**: Mechanical keyboards don't lose their tactile feel or responsiveness over time, unlike membrane keyboards that can become mushy or sticky. The keycaps can also be replaced easily if they get worn out or damaged.
- **Programmable**: Many mechanical keyboards have programmable features, such as macro keys, RGB lighting, media controls and custom layouts. This allows users to customize their keyboard to suit their preferences and needs.
- **Improved typing experience**: The tactile feedback and responsiveness of mechanical keyboards can help to improve your typing speed and accuracy⁵. The individual switches also prevent the keys from getting stuck or failing to register when typing quickly³.
- **Variety of choices**: Mechanical keyboards come in different sizes, shapes, colors and designs. Users can also choose from different types of switches, such as linear, tactile or clicky, that have different levels of force, travel and sound. This gives users more options to find their ideal keyboard.
- **Fun and satisfying**: Mechanical keyboards can be fun and satisfying to use, as they produce a satisfying click or clack sound with each keystroke. Some users also enjoy collecting and customizing their mechanical keyboards with different keycaps, switches and accessories.
