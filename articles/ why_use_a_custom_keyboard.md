# Why Use a Custom Keyboard?

A custom keyboard is a keyboard that you build or modify yourself to suit your personal preference and needs. There are many reasons why you may want to use a custom keyboard instead of a standard or pre-made one. Some of the benefits of using a custom keyboard are:

- **Personalization**: A custom keyboard allows you to choose every aspect of your keyboard, from the layout, size and shape, to the switches, keycaps and case. You can create a keyboard that reflects your personality, style and taste. You can also change or upgrade your keyboard anytime you want by swapping out parts or adding new features.
- **Ergonomics**: A custom keyboard allows you to optimize your keyboard for your comfort and health. You can choose a keyboard that fits your hand size, typing posture and style. You can also use ergonomic features like split keyboards, ortholinear layouts, thumb clusters and tenting to reduce strain and fatigue on your wrists, fingers and arms.
- **Functionality**: A custom keyboard allows you to enhance your keyboard's functionality and performance. You can use programmable features like layers, macros, combos and tap-dance to customize your keys and shortcuts. You can also use advanced features like RGB lighting, OLED display, audio support and wireless connectivity to add some flair and convenience to your keyboard.
- **Satisfaction**: A custom keyboard allows you to enjoy the satisfaction and pride of building something with your own hands. You can learn new skills like soldering, programming and designing. You can also join a community of enthusiasts who share your passion and hobby.
