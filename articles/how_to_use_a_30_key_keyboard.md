# How to Use a 30% Keyboard

A 30% keyboard is a keyboard that has only 30% of the keys of a standard full-size keyboard. It usually has around 30 to 40 keys, depending on the layout and design. A 30% keyboard is very compact and portable, but it also requires some learning and adaptation to use effectively. Here are some tips on how to use a 30% keyboard:

- **Learn the layout**: A 30% keyboard has a very minimal layout that only includes the most essential keys, such as letters, numbers and modifiers. It may also have some additional keys for functions, symbols or navigation. You will need to learn the layout of your keyboard and memorize where each key is located. You can use a keymap or a cheat sheet to help you with this.
- **Use layers**: A 30% keyboard relies heavily on layers to access all the keys and functions that are not available on the base layer. Layers are like virtual keyboards that you can switch to by holding or tapping a specific key. For example, you may have a layer for numbers and symbols, a layer for navigation and media controls, and a layer for programming and macros. You will need to learn how to use layers and customize them to your preference and needs. You can use a firmware like QMK or KMK to program your layers and assign them to different keys.
- **Use tap-dance**: Tap-dance is a feature that allows you to assign different actions to the same key based on how many times you tap it. For example, you can use tap-dance to activate KC.ESC on one tap, KC.LCTL on two taps and KC.LALT on three taps. This can help you save space and add functionality to your keys. You will need to learn how to use tap-dance and customize it to your preference and needs. You can use a firmware like QMK or KMK to program your tap-dance keys and assign them to different actions.
- **Practice and adapt**: A 30% keyboard may feel very different and challenging at first, especially if you are used to a larger keyboard. You may experience some typing errors, speed loss or discomfort at the beginning. However, with enough practice and adaptation, you can get used to a 30% keyboard and enjoy its benefits. You can practice your typing skills using online tools like TypingTest or Monkeytype. You can also adapt your typing posture and style to suit your keyboard.
