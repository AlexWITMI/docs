# How to Choose the Right Switch for Your Keyboard

Choosing the right switch for your mechanical keyboard is a matter of personal preference and intended use. There are three basic types of switches to choose from: linear, tactile and clicky . Here are some factors to consider when choosing a switch:

- **Environment**: You need to consider the place where you will be using the keyboard the most⁶. If you work or game in a quiet setting, such as an office or a bedroom, you may want to avoid loud clicky switches that can annoy others around you. Linear or tactile switches are usually quieter, especially if they have dampeners or o-rings to reduce the noise. If you work or game in a noisy setting, such as a cafe or a living room, you may not mind the sound of clicky switches, or you may even enjoy them for their satisfying feedback.
- **Purpose**: You need to consider what you will be using the keyboard for the most . If you are mainly gaming, you may prefer linear switches that offer a fast and smooth keystroke with minimal resistance or feedback. These switches can help you execute complex commands quickly and accurately. Some popular linear switches are Cherry MX Reds, Blacks, or Browns . If you are mainly typing, you may prefer tactile or clicky switches that offer a physical bump or a audible click when pushing down. These switches can help you improve your typing speed and accuracy by providing a clear indication of when a key is registered. Some popular tactile or clicky switches are Cherry MX Blues, Greens, or Clears . If you do both gaming and typing, you may want to find a balance between speed and feedback. Tactile switches are usually a good compromise, as they provide some tactility without being too loud or stiff.
- **Preference**: You need to consider your own preference and comfort when choosing a switch⁵. Different switches have different levels of force, travel and sound that can affect how they feel and work. Some people may like light and short switches that require less effort and movement to activate, while others may like heavy and long switches that provide more resistance and feedback. Some people may like silent and smooth switches that don't make any noise or bump, while others may like loud and crisp switches that produce a satisfying click or clack. The best way to find out your preference is to try out different switches yourself, either by buying a switch sampler or testing out different keyboards at a store or online.
- **Variety**: You need to consider the variety of choices available when choosing a switch³. There are many different brands and models of switches that offer different features and characteristics. Some of the most common brands are Cherry MX, Gateron, Kailh, Outemu and Razer. Each brand has its own color scheme and naming convention for its switches, but they usually follow the same pattern of linear, tactile and clicky. Within each type of switch, there are also different variations that differ in terms of force, travel and sound. For example, Cherry MX Reds are linear switches that require 45g of force to activate, while Cherry MX Blacks are linear switches that require 60g of force to activate. There are also some unique and innovative switches that offer something different from the norm, such as buckling spring, Gazzew Bobagum, Kailh Box Jade, Holy Panda X and Topre Type-S .

These are some of the factors to consider when choosing the right switch for your keyboard. Ultimately, it depends on your personal preference and intended use. There is no one best switch for everyone, but there is a best switch for you.
