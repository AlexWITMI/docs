# Unicorne MX Joystick Fix

There are two fixes for the Unicorne MX Joystick.

## Easy way 

On the back of the PCB you will see something like this:

all you need to do is solder a wire between the 2 pads marked.

This is quite easy the 2 pads are big and you just need to jump the 2 pads.


## Hard way


With the easy way you will have a wire on the back of your PCB. 

With the hard way you dont need a wire but its harder. 

On the top of of the PCB you will see a VIA on the top of the PCB next to the boot switch. I have marked it in red. 

Next to that via you need to scrape off the silk screen to reveal copper.
Next just us that as a jumper and jump it with solder.

You can see the jump marked in green.
