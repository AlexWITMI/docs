# Benefits of Split Keyboard

A split keyboard is a keyboard that is divided into two or more separate pieces that can be positioned at different angles and distances. Split keyboards are designed to provide better ergonomics and comfort for users who type a lot or have wrist or hand issues. Here are some of the benefits of using a split keyboard:

- **Prevent or reduce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome**: By alleviating pressure on wrists and joints, split keyboards guide users into their “perfect fit,” thereby reducing the likelihood that they will develop a repetitive strain injury (RSI)¹. Split keyboards also reduce ulnar deviation, which occurs when the wrist is bent outward in the direction of the little finger, and forearm pronation, which occurs when the palm is rotated face down². These postures can constrict the carpal tunnel and put pressure on the median nerve, causing pain, numbness and tingling in the hand and fingers.
- **Reduce absenteeism**: By preventing or reducing the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome and other RSIs, split keyboards can help users avoid taking sick leaves or losing productivity due to pain or discomfort¹. Split keyboards can also improve employee morale and satisfaction by showing that employers care about their health and well-being.
- **Increase productivity and efficiency**: By providing a more comfortable and natural typing experience, split keyboards can help users type faster and more accurately⁴. Split keyboards also create more space on the desktop for a pointing device, a numeric keypad, a smartphone, a tablet, documents or other accessories². This can reduce mouse reach, clutter and eye strain, and improve workflow and efficiency.
- **Increase employee retention rates**: By reducing absenteeism, increasing productivity and efficiency, and improving employee morale and satisfaction, split keyboards can help employers retain their valuable workers and reduce turnover costs¹. Split keyboards can also attract new talent by showing that employers are innovative and supportive of their employees' needs and preferences.
- **Avoid OSHA penalties**: By providing split keyboards as an ergonomic solution for their employees, employers can comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and avoid potential fines or lawsuits for violating workers' rights to a safe and healthy workplace¹.
