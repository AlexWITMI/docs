# What is ZMK Firmware?

ZMK Firmware is an open source (MIT) keyboard firmware built on the Zephyr™ Project Real Time Operating System (RTOS)¹. ZMK Firmware's goal is to provide a modern, wireless and powerful firmware free of licensing issues². Some of the features of ZMK Firmware are:

- **Wireless first**: ZMK Firmware is designed for the future, including wireless support for keyboards and devices. You can use your keyboard or device with any computer or mobile device that supports Bluetooth HID. You can also use split keyboards wirelessly with Bluetooth¹.
- **Support for over 100 keyboards and devices**: ZMK Firmware supports a wide range of keyboards and devices, from custom DIY projects to commercial products. You can browse the list of supported keyboards and devices on the ZMK website or on GitHub¹.
- **Fully programmable keymaps and macros**: ZMK Firmware allows you to create and edit your keyboard configuration through C++. You can assign any function, action or combination of keys to any key on your keyboard or device. You can also use advanced features such as tap-dance, combos, one-shot keys, mouse keys, rotary encoder support and more to customize your keyboard or device to your liking¹.
- **RGB lighting and audio support**: ZMK Firmware supports RGB lighting and audio features for your keyboard or device. You can control the color, brightness, animation and pattern of your RGB LEDs, as well as play sounds and music through your speakers or buzzer. You can also use RGB lighting and audio to provide feedback and indicators for your keyboard or device¹.
- **Easy to use tools and documentation**: ZMK Firmware provides easy to use tools and documentation for users of any skill level. You can use ZMK Configurator, a web-based graphical interface, to create and download firmware for your keyboard or device without any programming knowledge³. You can also use ZMK Toolbox, a desktop application, to flash firmware to your keyboard or device with a few clicks⁴. You can also find comprehensive documentation and tutorials on the ZMK website and GitHub¹.

These are some of the features of ZMK Firmware. If you are interested in using ZMK Firmware for your keyboard or device, you can follow the getting started guide on the ZMK website⁵ or visit the ZMK website for more information².
